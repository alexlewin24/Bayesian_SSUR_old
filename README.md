# Bayesian_SSUR

## Usage
Run the sample_conformant_data.R script to simulate some synthetic data.
This will produce a bash script to call the program on those data as well; results will be presented in a 'results' subdirectory.

As prompted by the script, to run simply input

    make && chmod +x call.sh && ./call.sh
    
in the console. Run

    make clean
    
to cleanup. NOTE THIS WILL ERASE THE RESULTS AS WELL.
